   DASUM - BLAS level one, sums the absolute values of the elements of
   a double precision vector
   
   * cblas_dasum.c
   *
   * The program is a C interface to dasum
   * It calls the fortran wrapper before calling dasum.

   CBLAS provides a C interface to the BLAS routines, which were
   originally written in FORTRAN.  CBLAS wrappers are already provided
   on Windows and OS X, but not on other UNIX-like operating systems
   (such as Linux). For most platforms (particularly AMD chips), I
   recommend Kazushige Goto's High-Performance BLAS Library:

   http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/goto/
   
   For more information on BLAS (including function definitions) see:
   http://www.netlib.org/blas/
   
   Note that I have only included wrappers for the BLAS functions which
   the Matching package actually uses.
